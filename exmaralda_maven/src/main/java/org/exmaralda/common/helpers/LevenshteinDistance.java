/**
 *  This classs holds the methods to compute a modified Levenshtein distance.
 * <p>
 * Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two <code>String</code> objects,
 * which we will refer to as the source string (s) and the target string (t). The distance is 
 * the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform s into t. 
 * For example, 
 * <p>
 * If s is "test" and t is "test", then LD(s,t) = 0, because no transformations are needed and the strings are already identical.<br/> 
 * If s is "test" and t is "tent", then LD(s,t) = 1, because one substitution (change "s" to "n") is sufficient to transform s into t. <br/>
 * <p>
 * The greater the Levenshtein distance, the more different the strings are. The measure is 
 * named after the Russian scientist Vladimir Levenshtein, who devised the algorithm in 1965.
 * If you can't spell or pronounce Levenshtein, the metric is also sometimes called edit distance. 
 *
 * TODO: The spelling checker currently doesn't use this class. The code also needs to be optimized.
 *

	 * The char arrays are being passed in to speed things up. Also,
	 * the lowercase char arrays are being passed in to speed things up.
	 * It was observed that in a typical invocation of this method, 
	 * this method gets called over and over again, with one of the
	 * strings being held constant, and one of them changing. By being
	 * able to pass in the char arrays, I can convert the string 
	 * that remains constant only once to a char array, and lowercase
	 * it only once. I can do array indexing rather than method invocation
	 * which should speed things up a bit as well.
	 * <p>
	 * To futher the efficiencies, this method returns an int of the
	 * distance that is the distance multiplied by 1000. 
	 * Thus, an edit distance of 2  multiplied by  1000 = 2000;
