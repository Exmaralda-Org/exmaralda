This distribution contains the three EXMARaLDA tools

- Partitur-Editor (transcription editor)
- CoMa (corpus manager)
- EXAKT (query tool)

To start any of the applications, make sure that the corresponding shell file (partitureditor.sh, coma.sh or exakt.sh, resp.) is executable and double click on it.
Shell scripts have been tested succesfully in the following configurations:

* SUSE Linux with Java 6
* UBUNTU Linux with Java 6

Please note that audio and video support is based on a java native interface (see FOBS_README).

Thanks to Jörg Sommer for helping us to improve this Linux distribution.
